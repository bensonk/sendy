## Sendy ##

Sendy is a tiny python script written to answer the question "What's the
simplest way to get these files to that computer?"  Create a directory, cd to
that directory, and run `sendy.py 4200`.  It will spin up a simple HTTP server
so you can visit http://localhost:4200/ and download the files.
