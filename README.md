## Sendy ##

Sendy is a tiny python script written to answer the question "What's the simplest way to get these files to that computer?"  Create a directory (e.g. `mkdir pub`), cd to that directory (with `cd pub`), and run `sendy.py 4200`.  It will spin up a simple HTTP server so you can visit `http://[machine address]:4200/` and download the files.
